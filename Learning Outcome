# Software-engineering-CS501
This course is aimed at helping students build up an understanding of how to develop a software system from scratch by guiding them thru
the development process and giving them the fundamental principles of system development with object oriented technology using UML. 
The course will initiate students to the different software process models, project management, software requirements engineering process,
systems analysis and design as a problem-solving activity, key elements of analysis and design, and the place of the analysis and design 
phases within the system development life cycle.
